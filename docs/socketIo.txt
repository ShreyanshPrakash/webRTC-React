SERVER : 

on the backendu need to create express then pass that to http and then pass that to socket.io

const app = require('express')();
const http = require('http').createServer(app);
const io = require('socket.io')(http);

// to listen to the port, since u r passing the express app to http, listen needs to be done on http
http.listen( 4200, () => console.log("Listening at port 4200"))
